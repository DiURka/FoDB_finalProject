It was renamed to Turkestan State University in 1920, then renamed to First Central Asian State University in 1923 and renamed again to Tashkent State University, named after Lenin in 1961 and finally named National University of Uzbekistan after Uzbekistan\'s independence.\r\n\r\nIn 1961-1969, NUUz won the first place among institutions in Central Asia in the contemporary system of education and became one of the most prestigious higher institutions of the Soviet Union. Many Central Asian national universities were established on the basis of the NUUz, including Abai Kazakh National Pedagogical University (1925), High Pedagogy Institute of Tajikistan (1932) and the Institute of Agriculture of Tajikistan (1931).\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, many academics relocated from cities in the western USSR to Central Asia, Tashkent and Alma-Ata, which were favored for their European-style infrastructure and the presence of a significant number of Russian speakers.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 2008, the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, signed the resolution of the 90th anniversary from the date of foundation of the university in September 1918.\r\n\r\nIn September 2018, two joint faculties with Kazan Federal University and Holonsky Israeli Technical Institute began to function.\r\nOrganization\r\n\r\nThe 15 faculties and 74 departments include:\r\n\r\n    Applied mathematics and intellectual technologies\r\n    Mathematics\r\n    Physics\r\n    Geology and geoinformation systems\r\n    Geography and natural resources\r\n    Chemistry\r\n    Biology\r\n    Social sciences\r\n    History\r\n    Economics\r\n    Foreign Philology\r\n    Journalism\r\n    Taekwondo and sport studies\r\n    Uzbek-Israel joint faculty of Mathematical engineering and computer science\r\n\r\nAn academic lyceum named after S.

The Tashkent University of Information Technologies was founded as the Tashkent Electro Technical Institute of Communication in 1955 and it was the major and only producer of communication engineers for the Central Asian region. Today, it is one of the major universities to nurture ICT talent in Uzbekistan. The university was named after Al-Khwarizmi by a presidential resolution to further boost its role within the nation and abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nAt the beginning, the institute was situated on the territory of the Tashkent Communication Polytechnic founded in 1930 (nowadays the Tashkent Vocational College of Communication) and was functioning there until the beginning of the academic year 1961–1962. The duties of the head (rector) of the institute were temporarily entrusted to N. B. Matskevich, chief of the Technical School of Communication. In the first academic year, 150 students were admitted to the University only on one specialization: telephone and telegraph communication. So the telephone and telegraph communication (TTC) faculty and four united departments were established. The first graduation of engineers took place in 1960.\r\n\r\nIn the academic year of 1957–58 the radio and broadcasting faculty (RBF) was opened and the institute began training radio and broadcasting engineers. In 1957 general-technical departments were established to train students in such specializations as telephony, telegraphy, communication lines, telecommunication, and power supply of communication enterprises. Since 1960 such departments as theoretical fundamentals of radio engineering; radio receivers; radio transmitters; broadcasting and television and some others were established.\r\n\r\nSince the academic year of 1964–65 on the base of TTC faculty the institute began to train students in two specializations: automatic telecommunication and multi-channel telecommunication. The TTC faculty was renamed the Automatic and Multi-Channel Telecommunication faculty (AMCTCF). In academic year 1969–1970 two independent faculties – Automatic Telecommunication (ATC) and Multi-Channel Telecommunication (MCTC) – were established. Since academic year 1964–65 some existing departments were reorganized or new ones established: the theory of linear electric network; the theory of signal transmission and the theory of nonlinear electric network; technical electrodynamics and antenna-feeder devices; measurements in communication engineering; automatic telecommunication; multi-channel telecommunication; transmission of discrete messages and telegraphy, etc.\r\n\r\nIn 1957, the institute opened night and correspondence departments with the following specializations: telephone and telegraph communication; radio and broadcasting. Since 1968 the institute has been paying particular attention to training working students — they introduced a new position of pro-rector for the night and correspondence departments.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the 1960s, the admittance of students to the daytime department was 400–450 persons; to the night and correspondence departments was 300 persons. Toward the second half of the 1970s, the number of daytime students came to 2000–2500 persons and night and correspondence students came to about 2000.\r\n\r\nSince the end of the 1950s, some special departments began scientific researches on the basis of economic contracts. For example, the communication lines department made research to determine the specific electro-conductivity of the ground in Central Asia, the department of theoretical fundamentals of radio engineering investigated magnetostrictive sifters. The first research laboratories with independent staff of research officers were established at that time.\r\n\r\nIn the 1970s the institute reached the level of training engineers with education quality, which wasn\'t inferior to other graduates of the same institutes established earlier. The institute became one of the prestigious educational institutions of the Republic with rather big scientific potential and a large number of lecturers with academic status and degrees. At that time the institute began to carry out big state budget and contract researches on developing new means of communication and new ways of signal transmitting, receiving and handling. At the same time the institute researched other adjacent spheres of national economy.\r\n\r\nIn 1991 the university opened a post-graduate course on two specialties and a special academic council on defending PhD theses started. Nowadays this post-graduate course prepares highly qualified specialists in five professions.\r\n\r\nSince 1993 a special military faculty has been functioning at the university. This faculty prepares communication officers mainly for troops of the Ministry of Defense and other power structures of the Republic Uzbekistan.\r\n\r\nSince 1996 the Central Asian Telecommunication Training Center for raising the level of engineers\' skills has been functioning at the University. This Center uses the grant TASIS TEMPUS under the program of the European Union Commission. About 100 lecturers and post-graduates raised the level of their skills in training centers of Belgium and Greece under this program. At the University there is also a Center for training women in information and telecommunication technologies established by the Trade and Development Agency and, besides that, there are courses under the CISCO program (US). All the preparations are being made to organize the joint Uzbek–Indian Training Center of Information Technologies. The University has established close friendly and business relationships with many relative higher education institutions of the world.\r\n\r\nTwo lyceums are functioning under the patronage of the University: Boarding School Lyceum and Academic Lyceum, each of them trains about 200,250 students. The classrooms of the lyceums are equipped with sufficient computers, including computers connected to the Internet. The library fund of the university has over 300,000 books and it is constantly increasing and renovating. There is also an electronic library connected to the local network of the university and to the Internet.\r\n\r\nThe university has a house of students for 700 persons, which has all necessary conditions for living, relaxation and sports. According to the president\'s decree dated 30 May 2002, the Tashkent Electro Technical Institute of Communication was reorganized into the Tashkent University of Information Technologies. The teaching staff got the instruction to fulfill their duties more properly and raise the level of education of Bachelors and Masters in information and computer technologies including information security and electronic commerce.\r\n\r\nThe Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministry of the Republic dated 2 June 2005 \"About development of the staff training system in the sphere of information technologies\" determined the Tashkent University of Information Technologies as the main educational institution preparing specialists in the sphere of information and communication technologies. There has been made a decision to open regional branches of the University in Nukus, Karshi, Samarkand, Fergana and Urgench.\r\nFaculties\r\n\r\nThe university trains Bachelors in 11 directions of education and Masters in 13 specialties.
